# CSEK Requirement Management System - First Release

First, run the following command to build and start all microservices as Docker containers:

docker-compose up --build


The frontend is developed using Flutter. To run it locally without CORS issues, launch Chrome with web security disabled using the command below:

"C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" --disable-web-security --user-data-dir="C:\temp-chrome-31"

Then -> flutter run -d chrome


After completing these steps, the CSEK Requirement Management System First Release will be ready to use.
