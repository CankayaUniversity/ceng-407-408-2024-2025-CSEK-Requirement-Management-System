# Project Description

---

*This project aims to develop a new, local, improved and AI powered requirements management system. One of the main aspects is the localization of the IBM Doors, which is a requirements management system tool used in the defense industry and has a high license fee. The main purpose of the project is to develop an easily accessible, evolvable, and inexpensive tool for our country by localizing this tool, which is of great importance to the defense industry. The project plans to offer AI powered additional features that IBM Doors does not have. The project aims to produce system requirements from User requirements using AI.*
